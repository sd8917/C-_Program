/*
operator in cpp :-
1.Assignment Operator
    X = 5;
    X = 10;
2.Bitwise Operator - Operator on bits
        &  -> Bitwise AND
        | ->Bitwise OR
        ^ ->bitwise XOR
        ~ ->bitwise NOT

3.SHift OPerator:-
    <<left shift
    >> right shift

4. Unary Operator
    & Address of operator
    * Dereferencing
    new,
    delete
    -
    +;eg:> -5(neg 5);


5.Arithmetic Operator
    * Multiplication


6.Ternary Operator
    condition ?TRUE : FALSE
    EG:-
    X =time>6am ? "Morning":"Evening".

7.Comma operator  (,)
eg:-
    int a;
    int b;
    int a,b,c;

8.Relational Operators
    5>7  - <=,<,>,>=,==,!=(Not equal to)
    x = 5 <- ASSIGNMENT EQUAL
    X==5 <-True.

9.Logical Operators
    and &&
    or ||
    eg:-
    (8>5 and 8%2==0) both condition check for the excuction

    (8>5 or 8%2==0) any will true will run the program inside this block

10.Post INC/DEC ++,--
 x = 5;
 x++; ->Post inc. x = x +1;

11.Compound Assignment
    x = x + 5;
    X += 5; <- Compound assignment
    X *=5 ;
    eg :- +=,-+,*+,/=,%=,<<=,>>= .
